## Repos

Grouping the repos here, listed by name and function:

### fapp_template

This is the standard flutter app template that the IDEs and the flutter sdk output when you create a project. The problem is that it's filled with bad-habits and wrong practices to follow. DO NOT EVER BUILD YOUR FLUTtER APP using those bad-habits. Instead, see my other repos and my articles and books so that you can reach flutter expert level in 1000 hours instead.

### fproject_layout

This is my general project setup that setups my project workflow automation stuff, a proper project readme, a suggestion architecture layout for the lib source folder, etc.

### flogging

This repo demos how to implement a complete logging strategy to turn all uncaught exceptions into caught exceptions by end of app development.

### fcatching

The code source shows how to use the Catcher-plugin to catch app-errors by logging app-exceptions to a 3rd-party services.
